# Using GraphDB to visualize the ontology

GraphDB is a very good tool to not only visualize the ontology but also test out Spark queries. 
SparkQL is the query language used in both GraphDB and Apache Jena to retrieve information from the ontology.

## Set up GraphDB

### Step 1

Go to https://graphdb.ontotext.com/ and download GraphDB.

### Step 2

Open GraphDB, it will open up a command window and it will open the DB on the browser. 
If the browser doesn't open, you may open the GraphDB Desktop window and press "Open GraphDB Workbench"
as seen in the following figure:

Once the browser window for GraphDB is open you may go to Setup, and then click repositories. 
From then on you should see a button to create Create New Repository as follows:
